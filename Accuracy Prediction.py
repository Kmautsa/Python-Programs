#description: Solution designed to analyze the average prediction accuracy of a machine learning model over the last three months.
#The accuracy scores for the last three months are 85.5%, 90.2%, and 87.3%.

# Accuracy scores for the last three months
accuracy_scores = [85.5, 90.2, 87.3]

# Calculate the average accuracy
average_accuracy = ((85.5+90.2+87.3)//3)
